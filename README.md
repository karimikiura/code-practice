# code-practice
This repository will document my coding practice journey.

# Introduction
* A journey of thousand miles starts with a single step!*

>  Disciple, Order & Consistency (DOC) will see me work through the simple, medium and difficult challenges I will encounter along the way.

## Where do I begin?

**TODO
### Introductory coding Challenges
- [ ] Factorial
### The factorial of a number is the function that multiplies the number by every natural number below it.
`n!` = > n!=1.2.3....n=`Product of the first n positive integers =  n(n-1)(n-2)…………………….(3)(2)(1)`
>eg. 4! = 4x3x2x1=24
